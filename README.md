This is a Python project that implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm for encryption and decryption of text. Users can input a message and a shift value to perform both encryption and decryption.

## Features
- Encrypt any given text with a user-defined shift.
- Decrypt any encrypted text using the same shift value.
